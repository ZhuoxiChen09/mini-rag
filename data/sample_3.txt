mini-rag — Purpose and usage

This repository is a minimal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) demonstration intended for local experimentation and teaching. It shows a compact pipeline that:

- Embeds local `.txt` documents using `sentence-transformers` (model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2).
- Splits long documents into overlapping chunks and stores chunk metadata.
- Builds a searchable embedding index (`artifacts/embeddings.npy` and `artifacts/chunks.json`).
- Retrieves relevant chunks by cosine similarity for a user query.
- Uses a small instruction-tuned language model (`google/flan-t5-base`) to generate concise answers based on retrieved context.

How to use:
1. Place source `.txt` files in the `data/` directory.
2. Run `python -m src.build_index` to generate the embedding index.
3. Run `python -m src.query_rag` and ask natural-language questions.

Goal: provide a reproducible, minimal example of a local RAG pipeline that is easy to read, modify, and extend.
